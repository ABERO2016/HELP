            <p>At the Hart Center at SMU-Lyle, we take the leadership and professional development of our students as seriously as their technical education. Our process starts with the Hart Leadership Assessment, a benchmark tool that reveals a student’s leadership strengths and identifies areas for growth. Leadership coaches help students analyze results and create personal development plans, which are updated and refined throughout their academic experience. Students learn and build skills that support teamwork, both in engineering design courses and in industry. Through student leadership positions, co-op work experiences and internship opportunities available at SMU and in Dallas-Fort Worth’s thriving business environment, students practice these skills and challenge themselves continually to reach their leadership and professional goals. The Hart Center’s assessment, challenge, and support approach to leadership development helps prepare Lyle students for the real business of engineering, by giving students the tools they need for the college to career transition and encouraging lifelong personal and professional growth.</p>

            <p>The Hart Leadership Portal is your dashboard for continous leadership development and home of the Hart Leadership Assessment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Hart Leadership Assessment is designed to help you evaluate your leadership capabilities in comparison to a “Good Leader” and a “Poor Leader” that you know. As the Hart Leadership Assessment is a self-assessment, the good/poor leader comparison helps you better rate your behavior based on your personal experiences with both good and bad leaders.</p>
            <p>The Hart Leadership Assessment assesses behavior-based competencies demonstrated by project and first level managers. The Hart Leadership Assessment is not a personality test nor does it claim anything definitive about you.  Your Hart Leadership Assessment Report result is merely feedback for you to consider in the context of this course or in other areas of your life.</p>
            <p>The Lyle Leadership Framework was customized specifically for engineering students. A group of Lyle faculty, staff, and colleagues from the Center for Creative Leadership created the framework to guide leadership development efforts in the Lyle School of Engineering. Leadership is a vast and complex phenomenon. This framework  does not intend to cover every aspect of leadership. Instead, it helps define the key elements of leadership relevant  to engineering and related disciplines.</p>
